Skeleton notebook sections

#	Section	Must include
1	Objective	Hypothesis, signal description, time period.
2	Data provenance	Feed source, version, row counts, gaps chart.
3	Leakage / look-ahead tests	Shifted-join check, gap between signal timestamp and trade timestamp.
4	Train / validation split	Walk-forward or expanding-window table.
5	Performance metrics	Annualised Sharpe, Sortino, max-DD, hit-rate, turnover; show OOS vs. IS.
6	Robustness sweeps	• Fee sensitivity plot (0–20 bps)
• Slippage stress
• Parameter grid heatmap (look-back × entry-zscore).
7	Statistical checks	Ljung-Box on residuals, White reality-check p-value, stationarity test on spread if stat-arb.
8	Risk controls	Kelly fraction vs. realised DD; VaR / ES table.
9	Conclusion & next steps	Failure modes, deployment readiness.
